# BioThings Progress Update

## Current Status: ✅ Fully Operational

### System Overview
The BioThings platform is now a complete AI-powered biotech company simulation using **Google Gemini** as the exclusive LLM provider.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. **Google Gemini Integration** ✅
- Simplified LLM service to ~100 lines (from 250+)
- Using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model
- Environment-based API key configuration
- Full LangChain integration

#### 2. **Executive AI Agents** ✅
- CEO: Strategic vision and decision-making
- CSO: Scientific research direction
- CFO: Financial planning and analysis
- CTO: Technology and infrastructure
- COO: Operations and efficiency

#### 3. **Advanced Biotech Workflows** ✅
- CRISPR gene editing protocols
- CAR-T cell therapy development
- High-throughput drug screening
- Protein production pipelines

#### 4. **Real-time Features** ✅
- WebSocket support for live updates
- Real-time metrics dashboard
- Agent collaboration messaging
- System health monitoring

#### 5. **Analytics Engine** ✅
- KPI tracking and visualization
- Predictive analytics with Gemini
- Executive report generation
- Anomaly detection

### Recent Fixes
- ✅ WebSocket 403 errors resolved (added `/ws/{client_id}` support)
- ✅ Missing API endpoints added (monitoring, workflows)
- ✅ Import path issues fixed
- ✅ Redis made optional for easier testing
- ✅ All tests passing with Gemini integration

### System Architecture
```
Backend (FastAPI + Gemini)
├── 5 Executive Agents
├── 4 Biotech Workflows  
├── Analytics Engine
├── WebSocket Support
└── 20+ API Endpoints

Frontend (Next.js)
├── Real-time Dashboard
├── Agent Chat Interface
├── Workflow Visualization
└── Metrics Display
```

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Test system health
python test_system_health.py

# Quick API test
python quick_api_test.py

# Start server
cd backend && source venv/bin/activate && python -m app.main

# Or use start script
./start_system.sh
```

### API Endpoints Working
- ✅ GET /api/health
- ✅ GET /api/agents
- ✅ POST /api/chat
- ✅ GET /api/workflows
- ✅ GET /api/monitoring/metrics/current
- ✅ GET /api/monitoring/alerts
- ✅ GET /api/metrics/dashboard
- ✅ WS /ws and /ws/{client_id}

### Environment Configuration
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyCi3bJgHqaOAObBBwLTqLPlnT4VUiECFos
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

### Performance Notes
- System runs without Redis (optional message broker)
- Fast response times with Gemini Flash model
- Efficient caching for conversation history
- Minimal dependencies for clean deployment

### UV Package Manager (Optional)
- Researched UV as faster pip alternative
- 10-100x faster package installation
- Built-in lock file support
- Can be used with: `./setup_with_uv.sh`

### Next Steps (When Needed)
1. Deploy to production with Docker
2. Add PostgreSQL for data persistence
3. Implement authentication system
4. Scale with multiple workers
5. Add more specialized agents

### Current State
The system is fully debugged and operational. All user-requested features have been implemented and tested. The platform demonstrates how Google Gemini can power a complete AI-driven biotech company simulation.
